# U09 React Weather App

School Assignment @ Chas Academy, class FWD20

---

>In this assignment, you will use the React library to build an application that displays weather based on the user's current position.

## Requirements

As a user, you should be able to do:

- [x] See the following weather conditions for their current position:
  - [x] Temperature
  - [x] Wind strength
  - [x] Humidity
  - [x] Sunrise and sunset (time)
  - [ ] Choose between Farenheit and Celsius
- [x] Get a forecast for weather conditions (as above) 5 days ahead
  - [x] Brief overview for the week
  - [x] Every three hours for the current day
  - [x] 5-day forecast

The finished solution must:

- [x] Use a weather API, e.g. [SMHI](https://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/), [YR.no](https://api.met.no/), [OpenWeatherMaps](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [x] Take advantage of positioning via geolocation in the browser
- [ ] Have design, layout and disposition based on [weather.com](https://weather.com/weather/today), or similar applications
