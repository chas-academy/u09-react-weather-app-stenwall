## Assignment

During this assignment, you will use the React library to build an application that displays weather based on the user's current position.

### Requirements

As a user, you should be able to do:

- [ ] See the following weather conditions for their current position:
  - [ ] Temperature
  - [ ]  Wind strength
  - [ ] Humidity
  - [ ] Sunrise and sunset (time)
  - [ ] Choose between Farenheit and Celsius
- [ ] Get a forecast for weather conditions (as above) 5 days ahead
  - [ ] Brief overview for the week
  - [ ] Every three hours for the current day
  - [ ] 5-day forecast

The finished solution must:

- [ ] Use a weather API, e.g. [SMHI](https://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/), [YR.no](https://api.met.no/), [OpenWeatherMaps](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [ ] Take advantage of positioning via geolocation in the browser
- [ ] Have design, layout and disposition based on [weather.com](https://weather.com/weather/today), or similar applications
